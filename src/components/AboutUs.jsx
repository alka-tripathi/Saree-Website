      <h1>About Satika</h1>
      <p>
        Satika derives from the Sanskrit word{' '}
        <strong className="highlight">śāṭikā</strong> (or “satika”), meaning a
        “strip of cloth” or a single piece of woven drape in ancient texts. The
        saree as we know it today evolved from that concept of one unstitched
        length of fabric.{' '}
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong className="highlight">Satika</strong> is a celebration of the
        timeless elegance and rich heritage of the Indian saree. In India, a
        saree is not just clothing—it is a reflection of{' '}
        <span className="highlight">culture, tradition, and identity</span>{' '}
        passed down through generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        A core purpose of Satika is <span className="highlight">awareness</span>
        . We believe women should know what they are wearing—where it comes
        from, how it is made, and the story behind every weave.
      </p>

      <p>
        Satika is more than an online store—it is a cultural space that
        encourages mindful fashion. By choosing to know what you wear, you take
        a step towards valuing craftsmanship, sustainability, and tradition.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also focus on fabric awareness. Whether it is silk, cotton, linen, or
        blended fabric, Satika helps you learn how the fabric is produced, how
        it feels on the skin, and why it is suited for different occasions and
        climates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through Satika, we hope to inspire women to wear sarees not just as
        attire, but as an expression of heritage, confidence, and pride.
